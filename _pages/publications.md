## Some codes
### Food delivery simulator
- Agent-based simulation with further possibility of secondary development
- Demo based on Hong Kong island (a topological network) and Singapore (real-world geometric road network)
- Introduction and more details [https://khzhang2.github.io/project/FD_simulator/](https://khzhang2.github.io/project/FD_simulator/)

### Simulate VRP
- A tool that you can play with on [https://khzhang2.github.io/_pages/simulateVRP.html](https://khzhang2.github.io/_pages/simulateVRP.html).
