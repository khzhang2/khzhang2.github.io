## Open-Sourced Tools
### Regional Partitioning of Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon District of Hong Kong City
- A dataset containing the data (vertices coordinates, connectivity, number of restaurants in each region, and geometry) of 32 regions of the HK island and the KL district.
- More details [here](https://github.com/khzhang2/HK_region_partition)

### Food Delivery System Simulator
- An agent-based model, can be built on a real-world road network
- More details [here](https://khzhang2.github.io/project/FD_simulator/)


### 2-D Frame Structure Solver Using the Direct Stiffness Method
- By inputting the external loads and the structure layout, users can obtain the element-end forces of a structure, as well as the resultant forces at each supporting node. The internal moment, shear force, and normal force diagrams of the structure are also shown in the result. Additionally, the nodal displacement is also calculated and the deformed shape is visualized as well.
