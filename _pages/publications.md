## Open-Sourced Tools
### Food Delivery System Simulator
- An agent-based model, demo on Hong Kong island (a topological network) and Singapore (real-world geometric road network)
- More details [here](https://khzhang2.github.io/project/FD_simulator/)


### Regional Partitioning Dataset of Hong Kong
- A dataset containing the partitioning data of Hong Kong (vertex coordinates, connectivity, number of restaurants in each region, geometry, etc).
- Collaborated with Mr. Jiadong Ren (summer intern student in 2023)
- More details [here](https://github.com/khzhang2/HK_region_partition)

### 2-D Frame Structure Solver Using the Direct Stiffness Method
- By inputting the external loads and the structure layout, users can obtain the element-end forces of a structure, as well as the resultant forces at each supporting node. The internal moment, shear force, and normal force diagrams of the structure are also shown in the result. Additionally, the nodal displacement is also calculated and the deformed shape is visualized as well.
