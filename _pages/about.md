I am a Ph.D. student of Traffic and Transportation Engineering at The University of Hong Kong. My research interest includes the modeling and optimization of on-demand mobility systems such as ride-sourcing and on-demand food delivery services. Before HKU, I worked on traffic state analysis and public transportation system designs. <br>
