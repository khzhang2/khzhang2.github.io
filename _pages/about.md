I am currently a Ph.D. student in traffic and transportation engineering at The University of Hong Kong under the supervision of Dr. Jintao Ke. My previous research interests mainly include the fields of traffic state forecasting and public transportation systems. I am now looking for new opportunities in emerging mobility services such as ride-sourcing and on-demand food delivery. <br>
