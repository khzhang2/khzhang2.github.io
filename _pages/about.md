<div class="intro">
I am a Ph.D. student in Traffic and Transportation Engineering at The University of Hong Kong. My research interests include modeling and optimization of on-demand mobility systems such as ride-sourcing and on-demand food delivery services. Prior to HKU, I worked on traffic state analysis and public transportation system design.
